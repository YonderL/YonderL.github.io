Hi! I'm Yang Liu, a junior undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at the College of Robotics, Hunan University. My academic journey centers around intelligent robotic systems, with specialized interests in robotics kinematics/dynamics, deep learning-driven perception, and generative models for visual understanding.

Focusing
======
🔭 Robotic Vision Systems: Developing computer vision algorithms for object recognition and scene reconstruction in dynamic environments
🧠 AI-Driven Control: Exploring neural network architectures for adaptive robot motion planning and manipulation tasks
🎨 Multimodal Generation: Investigating stable diffusion models for robotic simulation scene generation and dataset augmentation

My technical toolkit
======
💻 Programming: Python (PyTorch, OpenCV), C++, ROS
🛠️ Frameworks: TensorFlow, Gazebo, MATLAB/Simulink
🔬 Research Methods: SLAM implementation, GAN-based image synthesis, reinforcement learning pipelines

Future
======
I'm open to research collaborations and internships focused on intelligent perception systems or embodied AI. Let's connect and explore how generative models can revolutionize robotic autonomy!
