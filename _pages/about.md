Hi! I'm Yang Liu, a junior undergraduate student majoring in Robotics Engineering at the College of Robotics, Hunan University. My academic journey centers around intelligent robotic systems, with specialized interests in robotics kinematics/dynamics, deep learning-driven perception, and generative models for visual understanding.

Focusing
======
🔭 Robotic Vision Systems: Developing computer vision algorithms for object recognition and scene reconstruction in dynamic environments

🧠 AI-Driven Control: Exploring neural network architectures for adaptive robot motion planning and manipulation tasks

🎯 Image Generation and translation: Image generation and translation models (e.g., GANs/VAEs)

My technical toolkit
======
💻 Programming: Python (PyTorch, OpenCV), C++, ROS

🛠️ Frameworks: Pytorch, MATLAB/Simulink

🔬 Research Methods: GAN-based image synthesis, SLAM implementation

Future
======
I'm open to research collaborations and internships focused on intelligent perception systems or embodied AI. Let's connect and explore how generative models can revolutionize robotic autonomy!
